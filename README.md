# BlackJack
Blackjack project 

The object of the game is to win by creating card totals higher than those of the dealer's hand but not exceeding 21, or by stopping at a total in the hope that dealer will bust. On their turn, players choose to "hit" (take a card), "stand" (end their turn and stop without taking a card).

Number cards count as their number, the jack, queen, and king ("face cards" or "pictures") count as 10, and aces count as either 1 or 11 according to the player's choice. If the total exceeds 21 points, it busts, and all bets on it immediately lose.

After the player has finished playing, the dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand achieves a total of 17 or higher (a dealer total of 17 including an ace valued as 11, also known as a "soft 17", must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). If the dealer busts, the player hands win. If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher than the dealer's and loses if it is lower.

A player total of 21 is "blackjack", and the player wins immediately unless dealer also has 21, in which case the hand ties.


Player decisions

Hit: Take another card.

Stand: Take no more cards; also known as "stand pat", "sit", "stick", or "stay".


A hand can "hit" as many times as desired until the total is 21 or more. Players must stand on a total of 21. After the players hand is played, the dealer reveals the hole card and stands or draws according to the game's rules.
